## Authorea

-   Starting LaTeX error logging: <https://twitter.com/authorea/status/529731430574985216>

    Feature present in Share and WriteLaTeX.

-   Moving towards GitHub integration: `@natejenkins` created many test repos.

## Beegit

With all modesty and possible ignorance, I don't see what they do better than competitors so far, so I'm not optimistic.

## GitBook

Adds a web editor: <https://www.gitbook.com/blog/releases/webeditor>

## WriteLaTeX

WriteLaTeX moves to 5 people: <https://twitter.com/DrHammersley/status/529398276152229888>

They're putting their Digital Catalyst money to some use.
