# Competition

## WriteLaTeX

-   <http://www.thebookseller.com/news/futurebook-innovation-awards-shortlists-unveiled>

    WriteLaTeX gets another prize.

    I get the impression WriteLaTeX has better connections with the big boys,
    and puts more effort into politics than ShareLaTeX.

    Hard to say if that's the way to go, or to only on the product itself. Might be.

-   New intern: Desislav Hristov, Queen Mary student, totaling 4 people.

-   Inline comments: <https://www.writelatex.com/blog/176#.VEaTLIU1wjh>

    I'm against this feature. Commit comments and issues: good. Branch comments: bad.
    Not searchable, and can become dissociated from original content.

## O'Reilly Atlas

I've investigated their pull request mechanism so you don't have to do it yourself:

## Authorea

Confirmed some notable WONTFIXes on the project issue tracker:

- Side-by-side preview: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/270>
- git push and clone: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/266>
- merge requests: <https://www.authorea.com/issues/18>

Hiring 4 people: full-stack, front-end and 2 sales,
which will up the team to 7: <https://www.authorea.com/jobs>

## Penflip

-   <https://twitter.com/madebyloren/status/517041167062413314>

    Penflip looking for co-founders.

    Unclear if the team went up.

## GitHub

-   @schacon shows continuous interest in Atlas:

    - <https://github.com/schacon/atlas-api>
    - <http://forum.atlas.oreilly.com/users/schacon/activity>

    Is GitHub gonna move and kill us all? Probably just some pre-screening for now.

    UPDATE later in the month: schacon open sourced progit2 and claimed to use Atlas for it:
    <https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/31b9ca8b505398f7688146c12ed35e6b4fd16812/README.asc>

## Amazon

-   <https://writeon.amazon.com/>

    Not direct competition since focus on fiction and no collaboration,
    but considerable since done by a giant.
